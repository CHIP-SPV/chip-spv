Build procedure

We provide Makefile and CMake\+Lists.\+txt to build the samples seperately.

1.\+Makefile supports shared lib of hip-\/rocclr runtime and nvcc.

To build a sample, just type in sample folder,

make

2.\+CMake\+Lists.\+txt can support shared and static libs of hip-\/rocclr runtime.

To build a sample, run in the sample folder,

mkdir -\/p build \&\& cd build

rm -\/rf $\ast$ (to clear up)

a. to build with shared libs, run

cmake ..

b. to build with static libs, run

cmake -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+PREFIX\+\_\+\+PATH=\char`\"{}/opt/rocm/llvm/lib/cmake\char`\"{} ..

Then run,

make

Note that if you want debug version, add \char`\"{}-\/\+DCMAKE\+\_\+\+BUILD\+\_\+\+TYPE=\+Debug\char`\"{} in cmake cmd.
