Simple tool that prints properties for each device (from hip\+Get\+Device\+Properties), and compiler info. Properties includes all of the architectural feature flags for each device.

Also demonstrates how to use platform-\/specific compilation path (testing {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+HIP\+\_\+\+PLATFORM\+\_\+\+AMD\+\_\+\+\_\+} or {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+HIP\+\_\+\+PLATFORM\+\_\+\+NVIDIA\+\_\+\+\_\+})
